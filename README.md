## MOTIVATION:

Emotion recognition is a technique that allows reading the emotions on a human face using advanced image processing. In our daily life, we go through different situations and feelings about it. Emotion can be defined as a strong feeling about a human situation. These feelings and thoughts are expressed as facial expressions. The primary emotion levels are divided into many types like Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise.
It can be used in a variety of tasks:
### 1.	Emotion recognition in Health Care:

It helps to decide when patients necessitate medicine or to help out physicians determine who to see first. Software can help doctors with the diagnosis of diseases such as depression and anxiety. A ‘nurse bot’ not only reminds older patients on long-term medical programs to take their medication, but also converses with them every day to monitor the their overall wellbeing.


### 2.	Automotive industry and emotion recognition:

The automotive industry is also applying emotion recognition technology, as car manufacturers around the world are increasingly focusing on making cars more personal and safe for people to drive. Using facial emotion detection smart cars can alert the driver when he is feeling drowsy.


### 3.	Emotion recognition in video game testing:

Video games are designed with a specific target audience in mind and aim to evoke a particular behaviour and set of emotions from the users. Using facial emotion recognition can aid in understanding which emotions a user is experiencing in real-time as he or she is playing without analysing the complete video manually.


### 4.	Education:

Learning software prototypes have been developed to adapt to kids’ emotions. When the child shows frustration because a task is too difficult or too simple, the program adapts the task so it becomes less or more challenging. Another learning system helps autistic children recognize other people's emotions.


### 5.	Recruiting : 

Software is used during job interviews to understand the credibility of a candidate.


### 6.	Public service:

Partnerships between emotion AI technology vendors and surveillance camera providers have emerged. Cameras in public places in the United Arabic Emirates can detect people's facial expressions and, hence, understand the general mood of the population. 


### 7.	Retail:

Retailers have started looking into installing computer vision emotion AI technology in stores to capture demographic information and visitors' mood and reactions.
